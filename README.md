## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

I would like to build a fitness tracker for those that are working out and starting a new diet(losing weight or gaining weight). The app would have animations of different exercises and users can log the exercises they did everytime they went to the gym. They can also create routines and start those routines. Furthermore, the app also helps calculate the dietary nutritions a person, given their weight and height, should eat a day to achieve their goal. If possible, the app could also recommend some combinations of exercises and meals.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- I had some difficulties navigating XCode and figuring out where the features were.
